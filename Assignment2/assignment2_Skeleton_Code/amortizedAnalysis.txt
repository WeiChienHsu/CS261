## 1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 
      40 consecutive push operatinos on an empty array which starts out 
      at capacity 8, Assuming that they array will 
      "double in capacity each time"       
      a new item is added to an already full dynamic array?


      Answer: 96 Units

      As N (the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy
      for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?

      Answer: O(1)+ / Amortized O(1)


## 2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing
      40 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out
      a capacity 8, assuming that the array will: 
      "grow by a constant 2 spaces each time" 
      a new item is added to an already full dynamic array?

      Answer: 408 Units

      As N (the number of pushes) grows large, under this strategy
      for resizing, what is the average big-oh complexity for a push?

      Answer: O(n)
